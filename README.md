This project is a fork of a fork. It started with [GnomeHud](https://github.com/hardpixel/gnome-hud) and was later expanded upon by [Gonzaarcr](https://github.com/gonzaarcr). Consider buying him a [Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/gonza)!

FildemRevamped comes into play because [Gonzaarcr](https://github.com/gonzaarcr) disappeared from the scene, and the project stopped being maintained. Therefore, it won't work in the near future.

## What's Changed?

Everything.
