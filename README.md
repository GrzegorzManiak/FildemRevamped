This project is a fork of a fork. It started with [GnomeHud](https://github.com/hardpixel/gnome-hud) and was later expanded upon by [Gonzaarcr](https://github.com/gonzaarcr). Consider buying him a [Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/gonza)!

FildemRevamped comes into play because [Gonzaarcr](https://github.com/gonzaarcr) disappeared from the scene, and the project stopped being maintained. Therefore, it won't work in the near future.

## What's Changed?

So far, I've rewritten all the GJS from the ground up in TypeScript. The original project was just one file. I've also made bug fixes and general improvements.

The Python script running in the background will be rewritten soon, but for now, only minor tweaks have been and will be made.

## Installation

Currently, there is no installation guide, as this is one aspect I'm completely modifying. Users will be able to download the add-on from GNOME extensions without needing to download any other scripts, as all that will be done through the configuration menu.
